ðŸ“¦ Module: load_data.py

Utility functions for loading tabular data into pandas DataFrames.

This module provides reusable loading utilities used throughout the

serving as clean entry points for pipeline ingestion.

Functions:
- load_csv(path): Loads a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.
- load_joblib(path): Loads a joblib file.
